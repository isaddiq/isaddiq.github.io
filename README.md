**🧑‍🎓 About Me**


Hello! I’m Saddiq Ur Rehman, a PhD student at the Department of Architecture, Kyung Hee University, South Korea. I originally earned my Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar. 
My passion for Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced architectural technologies drove me to transition into the field of architecture.
I’m currently working on integrating cutting-edge technologies such as BIM, Modular Construction, Machine Learning, and Virtual Twin technologies to develop smarter, more efficient architectural designs.
